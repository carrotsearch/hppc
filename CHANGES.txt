** API-breaking changes

HPPC-117: A summary of API changes resulting from other issues.

          * (HPPC-118) Direct generic buffers are declared Object[].
          Should not affect runtime code (Object[] casts were required 
          anyway).

          * (HPPC-106) Guava adapters dropped. Copy to your own code
          from previous HPPC release if required.

          * 1.7 compatibility only. static factories removed, use diamonds.
          T.newInstanceWithCapacity(*)     -> removed, use new T<>(*)
          T.newInstanceWithExpectedSize(*) -> removed, use new T<>(*)
          T.newInstance(*)                 -> removed, use new T<>(*)
          T.from(container)                -> removed, use new T<>(container)
          
          * EmptyArrays has been removed. Empty arrays are now a static
            constant in each *ArrayList.
            
          * (HPPC-97) Removed allocated[] fields from hash containers. If
          you used explicit loops utilizing allocated[] you should rewrite
          them to use cursors or other form of iteration instead (it will
          be simpler than taking care of the empty slot marker).
          
          * (HPPC-146) Removed DoubleLinkedIntSet.

          * (HPPC-115) Hash containers now, by default, use a random internal
          mixing seed to reorder entries (so the order of keys is not 
          constant from execution to execution). See detailed HPPC-115 entry
          below.

          * (HPPC-121) Renamed methods:
          T.removeFirstOccurrences -> T.removeFirst
          T.removeLastOccurrences  -> T.removeLast
          T.removeAllOccurrences   -> T.removeAll(type)
          
          * (HPPC-123) Dropped MurmurHash3 class entirely.
          
          * (HPPC-125) The semantics of how equals works has changed (a container
          can be equal only if the comparison's target is of the same
          class and contains the same entries.
          
          * (HPPC-129) ArraySizingStrategy#round() method has been removed
          completely.

          * (HPPC-130) removeAll(KTypeLookupContainer) had an incorrect 
          generic signature of:
            public int removeAll(final KTypeLookupContainer<? extends KType> c)
          now corrected to:
            public int removeAll(final KTypeLookupContainer<? super KType> c)
          (for primitive types this does not apply).

          * (HPPC-131) retainAll(KTypeLookupContainer) had an incorrect 
          generic signature of:
            public int retainAll(final KTypeLookupContainer<? extends KType> c)
          now corrected to:
            public int retainAll(final KTypeLookupContainer<? super KType> c)
          (for primitive types this does not apply).
          
          * (HPPC-133) KTypeContainer.toArray(Class<T>) now accepts any array
          component type; runtime checks will throw ArrayStoreException if not
          compatible.
          
          * (HPPC-135) KTypeVTypeAssociativeContainer#removeAll had an incorrect 
          generic signature of:
            public int removeAll(KTypeContainer<? extends KType> container)
          now corrected to:
            public int removeAll(KTypeContainer<? super KType> container)
            
          * (HPPC-116): Dropped methods that required a memory write (lset, lget, 
          lkey) and replaced them with methods that take a logical "index" of a
          key:
            int indexOf(KType);
            boolean indexExists(int index);
            VType indexGet(int index);
            VType indexReplace(int index, VType newValue);
            void indexInsert(int index, KType key, VType value);
          So, for example:
            int index;
            if ((index = map.indexOf(key)) >= 0) {
              // key exists, do something with the value.
              doSomething(map.indexGet(index));
            } else {
              // Insert the new key-value pair.
              map.indexInsert(index, key, newValue);
            }
            
          * (HPPC-141): Dropped mutable type wrappers.
          
          * (HPPC-144): Several less-frequently used classes have been moved to 
          a separate JAR file. See full description of HPPC-144 below.
          
          * (HPPC-145): Removed any "Open" infix from all classes:
          KTypeOpenHashSet -> KTypeHashSet
          KTypeVTypeOpenHashMap -> KTypeVTypeHashMap
          
          * (HPPC-152) XorShiftRandom has been removed and replaced with a
          simpler, int-only PRNG XorShift128+ (XorShift128P). 

** New features

HPPC-150: Make the default key mixing strategy globally configurable (via 
          "hppc.bitmixer" sysprop). This property allows switching from
          random bit mixer strategy to any of the following:
          - random 
              the default strategy. Varies bit mixer per instance. 
          - deterministic 
              the default strategy in HPPC up to v. 0.6.x. Varies bit
              mixer depending on hash container size.
          - none
              No bit mixing is used (hash sets/maps become scatter sets/ maps).

          This is a last-resort, discouraged, property. Your code should not 
          rely on hash map/set ordering. Your code should use scatter maps when
          speed is of absolute importance and there are guarantees that keys
          won't be copied around to other associative containers.

HPPC-145: Removed any "Open" infix from all classes. 

HPPC-144: Moved certain esoteric key/value containers to a separate JAR. This
          JAR has an identical dependency as main HPPC jar, but is declared with
          an "esoteric" classifier. The following containers are included
          in the set of "esoteric" ones:
          * all associative containers with Byte* keys
          * all associative containers with Float* keys
          * all associative containers with Double* keys
          
          Byte-keyed containers are very infrequent (just create a plain array 
          for values). Hash containers keyed by a floating-point type are odd
          and may lead to confusion. The problem is how the "key" should be 
          normalized from fixed-bit representation and then internally compared.
          If fp normalization is applied (like Double.doubleToLongBits) then 
          the value one puts in a set or a map may be different from the value 
          later retrieved while iterating over the set of keys. On the other 
          hand, if one takes raw floating point values (for example 
          Double.doubleToRawLongBits) then there are awkward side-effects 
          (like various types of NaNs can be stored as separate keys, for 
          example).
          
          All floating-point "esoterics" use proper normalization, but it is 
          strongly advised to manually apply the floating point-fixed-point 
          conversion (normalization) in the target code and just use
          a corresponding fixed-point associative container for storing 
          normalized values.  

HPPC-143: Added KTypeScatterSet and KTypeVTypeScatterMap. These classes are
          specializations of KTypeHashSet and KTypeVTypeHashMap with
          a simpler bit distribution function and no bit mixers. They are
          useful for key existence checks or counting but should not be 
          propagated across containers.

HPPC-134: Set and Map's removeAll() should pick the best removal strategy.

HPPC-139: Added release() to the API (clears and releases internal buffers).

HPPC-116: Drop methods that require memory write (lset, lget, lkey) and replace
          them with methods that take a logical "index" of a key.

HPPC-115: Provide better guard against key clustering leading to 
          exponential times.

HPPC-97:  Use unallocated slot marker key instead of an explicit 
          allocation table for hash containers. This should result in memory
          savings and even speedups resulting from fewer memory accesses.

HPPC-112: ensureCapacity(elements) added to all containers.

HPPC-113: Clean up the definition of "capacity" vs. buffer size. Initial
          capacity is now the number of elements that can be stored without
          hash container rehash.
          
          A few methods have been removed or renamed because the meaning of
          "capacity" and presizing for the given number of expected elements
          is now equivalent. See API changes.

HPPC-114: Buffer resizing and allocation should be throwing non-assertion 
          mode exceptions. This is an unchecked exception. It will also
          leave the data structure in a consistent state.

** Bug fixes

HPPC-135: KTypeVTypeAssociativeContainer#removeAll had an incorrect generic 
          signature.

HPPC-133: KTypeContainer.toArray(Class) can return incorrect array type.

HPPC-131: retainAll(KTypeLookupContainer) had an incorrect generic 
          signature.

HPPC-130: removeAll(KTypeLookupContainer) had an incorrect generic 
          signature.

HPPC-115: Hash containers now, by default, use a random internal
          mixing seed to reorder entries. This is done to prevent a potential
          (but likely!) case of exponential costs of merging keys from two
          or more containers. If you desperately need non-permuted order,
          use an explicit constructor and pass HashOrderMixing.none()
          as the mixing strategy. Carefully weigh the risk of stalling your
          program with data-related deadlocks; this is only useful if you're 
          using hash container as a scatter table (without merging it with
          anything else). 
          
          You can also provide your own strategy to get predictable hash
          key ordering. Just make sure the mix seed is different from container
          to container (for example by using a thread local increment 
          counter or something like that).

** Other changes

HPPC-152: Remove XorShiftRandom (add a simpler RPRG: XorShift128+).

HPPC-149: Recognize tests.seed as the initialization seed for randomized 
          key mix strategies.

HPPC-102: Use Arrays.copyOf instead of new[]+System.arraycopy() for resizing 
          arrays.

HPPC-141: Dropped mutable type wrappers (*Holder). 

HPPC-128: The preprocessor (intrinsics, preprocessor) is now deployed as part 
          of the official release.

HPPC-138: Move Intrinsics class to the generator project. Add forbidden-API 
          checks to ensure intrinsics are replaced.

HPPC-137: An overhaul of intrinsics (equality comparisons, no vtype/ ktype 
          distinction, etc.)

HPPC-129: ArraySizingStrategy#round() method has been removed completely.

HPPC-125: The equals method should not return true when comparing against
          subclasses of the current object. This can be very misleading, 
          especially when the subclass has a different implementation of
          key comparisons, etc. 

HPPC-123: Dropped MurmurHash3 class entirely.

HPPC-121: Rename remove{All|First|Last}Occurrence(s) to 
          remove{All|First|Last}(key).

HPPC-146: Removed IntDoubleLinkedSet.

HPPC-120: Rework entry shifting routine to be less hairy.

HPPC-106: Drop Guava adapter (and dependency).

HPPC-118: Buffers for generic classes are now declared as Object[] and not as
          generic type array. This prevents problems with compiler-injected
          casts (it does not matter for the erased type but matters in user
          code).

HPPC-105: Cleanup project structure and IDE integration.

HPPC-109: Moved @author tags to NOTICE.txt.

** API-breaking changes:

HPPC-66: allow retrieving key instances by key-equality from Object*Map versions of 
         hash maps. Renamed lget in KTypeOpenHashSet to lkey for consistency. 
         So, the methods accessing last found key in sets and maps are: 
         lget (maps, accesses last value), lset (maps, accesses last value), 
         lkey (maps, sets, accesses last key), lslot (both, slot index).

HPPC-68: Lifted final markers on public methods

** New features

HPPC-63: a jdk15-compatible artifact is being published to Maven Central now.

HPPC-66: allow retrieving key instances by key-equality from Object*Map versions of 
         hash maps and hash sets.

HPPC-69: added toString to cursors.

HPPC-77: BitSet should use hotspot intrinsics (popcnt mostly)

** Bug fixes

HPPC-65: putOrAdd uses == for comparing object keys instead of equality

HPPC-72: XorShiftRandom always returns a zero. [Sergey Peretyatko] 
         This class was used only in benchmarks and tests so unless
         you're using it directly you're not affected.
         
HPPC-73: get, contains and any other method may block indefinitely with 
         high load factors and full storage array capacity

HPPC-74: Load factor is not used in KTypeOpenHashSet

HPPC-75: put or add may leave the internal state of the hash containers 
         inconsistent on OOM conditions

** Other
