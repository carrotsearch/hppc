        High Performance Primitive Collections (HPPC) library provides
        typical data structures (lists, stacks, maps) 
        template-generated for all Java primitive types 
        (<code>byte</code>, <code>int</code>, etc.) to conserve 
        memory and boost performance.

        <h2>Why HPPC?</h2>

        <p>The Java Collections package is in many ways excellent, but it cannot
        be used for primitive types and autoboxing introduced in Java 1.5
        kills the runtime performance (increased memory use, garbage collector overhead).</p>

        <p>This library has different design goals than Java Collections (and many other
        collection packages). For example, the internals of each class are open
        and subject to free hacking and tuning up to one's wishes.</p>


        <h2>Why not other primitive collection libraries?</h2>

        <p>There are a few projects implementing collections over primitive types:
            <a href="http://fastutil.dsi.unimi.it/">fastutil</a>,
            <a href="http://pcj.sourceforge.net/">PCJ</a>,
            <a href="http://trove4j.sourceforge.net/">GNU Trove</a>,
            <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/">Apache Mahout (ported COLT collections)</a>,
            <a href="http://commons.apache.org/primitives/">Apache Primitive Collections</a>.</p> 

        <p>Some of these are LGPL-ed, a license type many commercial companies
        tend to avoid at all costs; other projects above are no longer
        maintained or complete. There is also a tendency to write tightly encapsulated
        code (private internals), implementing the API of standard Java packages and 
        striving for fast error-recovery. Although these are good programming
        practices, they are not always practical (in many computationally intense applications
        access to the collection class' internals is a bliss). HPPC has a slightly
        different set of goals.</p>


        <h2>Assumptions and goals of HPPC</h2>

        <p>We assume that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The programmer knows what he's doing and may wish to access internal
            storage of a given collection's class directly (not using predefined
            iterators, for example).</li>

            <li>Vast majority of scenarios use single-threaded access. There is little
            point in repeated verification of concurrent modifications, for example.</li>

            <li>The programs (algorithms) that use primitive collections are unit-tested
            and regression-tested during development, so their behavior in production
            systems does not have to be restrictively verified (we can assume the code
            using the collection class won't violate the given set of assertions).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From these assumptions stem the following design drivers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data types in the HPPC are as simple as possible and expose
            internal storage for any optimisations one may wish to do from within the 
            end-application code.</li>

            <li>Verification of parameter and state validity is done <b>optionally</b>
            using assertions. This means that contracts are only checked if requested at
            runtime (using Java 1.4+ <code>-ea</code> switch). When the algorithm is tested and verified,
            it can run with no additional overhead from contract checks.</li>

            <li>There are no complex interface hierarchies, superclasses, specialisations, etc. The
            programmer chooses a given list at design-time and he knows what he's doing.</li>

            <li>HPPC provides utilities for the most common tasks like filtering, iterating
            or joining collections, but these utilities are usually more expensive than implementing
            a low-level direct access to the data storage (which may be done if needed).</li>

            <li>There is no special support for data serialization.</li>

            <li>The implementation is not thread safe.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Design and implementation assumptions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We want HPPC class templates to be implemented using regular Java (with generics) 
            so that typical programming tools can be used for development, testing, etc.</li>

            <li>We want HPPC class templates to be usable as generic-collection classes (for boxed
            numeric types or any other <code>Object</code> types), but at the same time we want
            specialized classes automatically-generated for primitive-types 
            (to limit memory consumption and boost performance due to JIT optimisations).</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h2>Interfaces and their relation to Java Collections API</h2>
        <p>HPPC is not strictly modeled after Java Collections API, although we did
        try to make the APIs look similar enough for comfortable use. 
        One particular thing not found in HPPC are view projections 
        (views over the collection of keys or values). These views
        can be implemented with closure-like filters on top of HPPC or
        by accessing the exposed data fields of each class (the internals are known,
        after all).</p>

        <p>Rough relationships between Java Collections classes and HPPC classes are
        presented in the table below.</p>
